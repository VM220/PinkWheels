           <strong>1. I'm experiencing payment issues while booking a cab.What should I do?</strong><br>

           If you encounter any payment issues while booking a cab, we understand how frustrating this can be. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the problem:<br>
            
            <strong>Check your payment method:</strong> Ensure that the payment method you're using (credit card, debit card, digital wallet, etc.) is valid and has sufficient funds or credit available to complete the transaction.<br>
            
            <strong>Refresh and try again:</strong>Sometimes, payment gateways may experience temporary issues. Try refreshing the page or app and attempt to make the payment again.<br>
            
            <strong>Contact your bank or payment provider:</strong>If the problem persists, it's possible that your bank or payment provider may be blocking the transaction for security reasons. Contact them to verify if there are any restrictions on your account or if there are any pending authorizations.<br>
            
            <strong>Try a different payment method:</strong> If possible, try using an alternative payment method to complete the booking. This could involve using a different credit card, debit card, or digital wallet.<br>
            
            <strong>Contact customer support:</strong> If none of the above steps resolve the issue, please reach out to our customer support team for assistance. Our support representatives will be happy to help troubleshoot the problem and ensure that your booking is processed smoothly.<br><br>
            
            <strong>2. I was charged multiple times for the same booking. What should I do?</strong><br>
            
            If you notice multiple charges on your account for the same booking, please don't worry. This can sometimes happen due to temporary glitches in the payment system. Here's what you can do:<br>
            
           <strong> Check for duplicate bookings:</strong> Verify if multiple bookings were actually made for the same trip. If there are duplicate bookings, you can proceed to cancel the extra bookings to avoid being charged unnecessarily.<br>
            
            <strong>Contact customer support:</strong> If you've been charged multiple times for the same booking but didn't receive multiple booking confirmations, please contact our customer support team immediately. Provide them with details of the charges, including transaction IDs and booking references, so they can investigate the issue and initiate a refund if necessary.<br><br>
